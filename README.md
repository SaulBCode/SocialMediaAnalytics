# EDA and Stats Analysis for Social Media Data

## Introduction
This project focuses on analysing a kaggle dataset containing information on user comments about popular brands during various stages of launch of their products. The first part of the project is an exploratory data analysis. Using this I gather descriptive data (such as average sentiment score or impressions) to provide marketing recommendations to stakeholders. These stakeholders include major brands as well as smaller business looking to expland the large social media campaigns. 

The second part of the project uses statistical analysis in R. It relies on the dataset imported from SQL and works to determine whether the initial observations from the EDA are statistically significance. This allows stakeholders to determine whether patterns observed are due to chance or can be attributed to other explanatory variables such as campaign phase or social media platform.

## EDA Insights 
The analysis revealed data like the best month to start a campaign on a given platform e.g. Facebook (April).
We also learned that different platforms had distinct user responses at different stages of launch.

### Pre – Launch insights 
Reddit Provided best engagement pre-launch This suggests that reddit might be a good platform to investigate consumer opinion at the pre-launch stage.
 In terms of impressions however Facebook and YouTube were the top platforms for 8 / 10 brands collectively. Therefore, it could be cost effective to put more funding into these platforms to raise awareness of the launch of a new product. 
YouTube had the most negative sentiment pre-launch for half of the brands considered – this means that Facebook is likely the best platform to use to raise awareness of a new product launch. 

### Launch Insights 
During launch impressions were highest with YouTube whilst engagement was highest with reddit and twitter. 
The most positive sentiment was expressed with twitter – suggesting that twitter may be a better platform to prioritise during launch
### Post - Launch Insights 
After launch impressions were similar across platforms but highest across twitter with 3 brand having their highest impression count on twitter post launch. Engagement was highest with Instagram and Facebook and the most positive sentiment ws present on twitter and Instagram. This means that Instagram might be the best platform to prioritise post launch since engagement is higher and sentiment is more positive.
